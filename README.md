**Title:** IPA Converter

A simple phonetics tool designed to help language learners understand pronunciation through the international Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). 

**Guiding Question:** 
Given a word or sentence, how can phonetic transcription help a learner better understand its pronunciation? 

This project takes written text as input and outputs its corresponding IPA transcription making pronunciation explicit and accessible—especially for learners who struggle with irregular spelling-to-sound correspondences.

This project is the blend of computational linguistics, phonetics, and computer science, focusing on clarity, usability, and linguistics accuracy. 


**Computational Linguistics Concepts:**
- Phonetics and Phonology: Representation of sounds using IPA symbols.
- Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion (G2P): Translating written words into their phonetic pronunciation.
- String Processing / Tokenization: Breaking input into words or syllables for phonetic analysis.
- Optional NLP components: e.g., text normalization, handling homographs.

These concepts demonstrate ho computtional methods can be applied to mode  and manipulate human lanuage sounds. 


**Instalation and Setup:**
1. Clone the repository 
git clone https://github.com/HilarieSherile/project1_phonetics.git
cd project1_phonetics

2. Install dependencies 
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the pogram 
python ipa_converter.py


**Usage Instructions:**
1. Input a word or sentence in the terminal. 
2. The program outputs the IPA transcription. 

Example: 
Input: hello
Output: həˈloʊ

You can use this tool to practice pronunciation, create phonetic dictionaries, or integrate it into language learning applications.
